### 1. iOS apps generate greater revenue in comparison to android apps

One of the major differences between Google Play Store (for android) and Apple iTunes Store (for iOS) is that apps on Apple’s store usually have a cost attached to them and users are accustomed to making payment for apps on this online store. Google’s store has a lot of free apps which is an obstacle considering that such users do not wish to make payments for apps. iOS apps receive substantial benefit as the funds are sourced to the developers and this is lucrative business opportunity for them. An example of this difference is evident in the fact that Android developers earn an estimated 23 cents for every dollar that an iOS developer earns. In more realistic implications, it is safe to state that iOS applications earn double the revenue that is obtained from the Google Play Store. This clearly indicates that the Apple Store is the most lucrative digital market where developers can sell their apps. One of the most common reasons that is often associated as being the factor behind higher revenue generation on Apple’s store is that an average iOS user spends more time using the services of their devices in comparison to an Android user. Hence this is a profitable shift considering the financial benefits and business opportunities associated with it.
