### 1. Android has the biggest market share

Google's Android and Apple's iOS are the largest players in the mobile app market. ** Android has taken the lead by a long shot with over 900 million activations**, while iOS comes a distant second with 410 million, recent statistics revealed. Depending on the source you use, Android enjoys up to **70% of the global market**.

What does this mean for businesses? It used to be a good strategy to develop for iOS first and not think about Android for a long time.
