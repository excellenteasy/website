### 5. Google Play has outstanding marketing opportunities

Metadata is the most important factor of app discoverability. Once your app is ready for sale **on the iOS App Store, making amends in the title, description or screenshots is quite a hassle**. For such changes to take effect you need to submit a new version of the app. Not only is this expensive, but it might take as long as three weeks. Apple has recently been much stricter about this compared to the past years. Apps are now often rejected just because they seem to not change much but the keywords or screenshots. Imagine you have an important bug fix, but the reviewer won't let your app through, because it doesn't appear to be much different?!

In contrast, **changing the metadata is a breeze with the Google Play Store on Android**. You can edit your app, update the title or make any necessary changes and instantly publish. There's more to it than that. There is an even richer way to present your app with a featured video.
