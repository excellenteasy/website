### 4. iOS apps are subject to less fragmentation and increased stability in comparison to Android apps

One of the things which Apple has always been known for is its adherence to simplicity. iOS devices come in two basic configurations (phone and tablet) with an internal feature of the iOS app development environment that aids the developer in resolving all issues pertaining to the maintenance of the apps compatibility with different devices. Android, on the other hand, has been identified as being extremely fragmented with a large number of screen sizes, orientation compatibility based on size, viewing quality and hardware compatibility. Addressing issues in all of these areas involves time and money which is easily avoidable with the use of iOS apps. Moreover, the iOS updates arrive at the same time for all devices, resulting in minimal or no changes to be made in the app to maintain compatibility with the updated operating system. It is due this standard infrastructure of iOS services that the stability of such apps are ensured to be high. iOS developers can devote more time on important issues concerning further enhancement of the application and other requirements that may hold priority status.
