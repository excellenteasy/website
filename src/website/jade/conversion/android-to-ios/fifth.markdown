### 5. iOS apps provide better visibility not only for the apps but also for their owners

The iTunes store is a huge searchable database comprising verified applications that have accurate description of the app’s developer / developing organization. Due to the large size of Apple’s database, the information contained in it gets linked to popular search engines, which leads to the developer’s name being highlighted in the general search results as well. This acts as a complementary SEO undertaking where the visibility of the app and its brand is made available to greater audience, thereby ensuring greater reach for the app. Such visibility is crucial for generating the required revenues and also for targeting larger consumer bases for expanding the scope of the respective business. Such benefits are available only when non-iOS apps are ported onto iOS platform. Additionally, the enhanced visibility of the app and its brand saves up on the marketing costs of the company which acts as an indirect benefit. Apple being a global brand, enables the apps to be made available to either global audience or region-specific audience. This helps the business to establish a global image with profitable opportunities being made available owing to enhanced online visibility.
