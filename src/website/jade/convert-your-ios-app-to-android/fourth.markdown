### 4. Make yourself independent

Most developers, both independent and corporate, do not focus on a single mobile platform. Almost all **major apps in the market today have versions compatible with both iOS and Android**. And for good reason: Not only do these businesses have the vast majority of the market share available, they also avoid any single point of failure.

It is necessary to **split your revenue into several streams** so you can't be out of business overnight. This sounds really simple and obvious, right? For years, too many businesses and developers have developed only for iOS. Sometimes yielding great profits in the beginning, but too often being cut off literally over night by being removed from the App Store.

While Apple might deprecate an iOS feature, or remove your app from the store you could still be available on Android, or vice-versa. Remove such factors you can't influence from your business to ensure healthy and steady growth. "Never put all your eggs in one basket."
