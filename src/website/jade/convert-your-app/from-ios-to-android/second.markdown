### 2. Android devices are cheap

iOS is compatible with devices manufactured by Apple alone, namely the **iPhone and the iPad series**. These devices are **quite expensive** and are usually bought by retail customers. The fact that Apple just presented their "cheap" iPhone c, starting at 599â‚¬, doesn't change this at all. Even the tablet market is leaning towards cheap alternatives to the iPad now. The **Android platform is compatible with a large number of devices** which cut across different price ranges.

Not only is there a diverse customer base for Android devices, because everyone from student to professional can afford them, but you can **easily purchase Android devices in bulk for very specialized use-cases**. Just think of a field work staff, in-house applications or fields like outdoor use where you have to expect stolen or destroyed devices.

We have worked with clients who thought about creating an app for their internal business processes for a long time. But buying 50 iPads is still quite an expense. With the Nexus 7, for example, the equation is changed completely. Imagine the possibilities that all kinds of hardware allow. Envision all the circumstances, that your app can suddenly be ten times as useful.
