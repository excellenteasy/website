### 3. Google Play is publisher friendly

iOS App publishing is a lucrative business opportunity, but it requires an immense upfront investment. Once your app is developed, you would want it out on the market as soon as possible. Maybe you even need to meet a certain deadline for an event. However, if you have developed an app compatible for iOS only, surprises might be manyfold. If you have been **rejected by Apple**, you know what we are talking about.

**On Android's app store – Google Play – all you need to launch an app is a developer account**. Your app gets a listing without being reviewed, so you have a better shot at recovering your costs and taking higher risks for new and innovative approaches. This is worth repeating: You will not be stuck in review. What a world of opportunity. Fast releases and testing suddenly became so much easier, right?

It gets even better. With recently introduced features, Google Play allows you to roll out new versions of your apps to a limited percentage of your user base. By doing this, you can test new features, bug fixes or styling changes and get early feedback without burning your entire customer base.
