### 3. iOS apps have greater reliability than Android apps

A key feature of Appleâ€™s store is its intensive and exhaustive review process wherein every app that is submitted to the store is reviewed for all possible bugs before it is provided approval. This is a huge quality assurance and forms the basis for the confidence of the users in iOS apps. Due to such stringent quality assurance measures and accurate app provider descriptions, it is easy to verify the reliability of these apps. Android apps on the Google store may not have undergone a mandatory review process. This is the reason behind the existence of various useless or non-performing apps. It is due to this that users are often deterred from exploring the Android market extensively. With greater reliability in iOS apps, users have an increased willingness to try new apps without the fear of the device being affected by malware or faulty applications. This helps to build greater faith on the business that has related apps on the iOS platform. From a business perspective, such reliability and faith is beneficial for garnering new consumers and also for retaining existing consumers. This is why business entities have sought to convert their Android apps (if any) to iOS.
