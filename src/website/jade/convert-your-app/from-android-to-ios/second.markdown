### 2. iOS apps help in establishing strong brand values.

Apps that have initially been made only for the Android platform often see their porting onto native iOS platform due to the niche segmentation of the Apple brand. Apple’s products are known for being luxurious with offerings including revolutionary products such as the iPhone and the iPad. Consumers have a common perception that applications being made available on the iOS platform are premium in nature due to their being deployed on Apple’s products. This is a perception that extends beyond technological implications and has its presence on the business aspect. Any business involved in the premium product / service sales using iOS apps is considered to have strong brand values which are essential for creating larger consumer bases. It is due to this very reason that iOS port of Android apps is gaining preference among businesses as well as app developers. An iOS app is generally reflective of the core principles of Apple itself which include high quality assurance, reliable performance, innovation and customer orientation.
