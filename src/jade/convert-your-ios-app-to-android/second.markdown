# 2. Android devices are cheap
iOS is compatible with devices manufactured by Apple alone, namely, the iphone and the ipad series. These devices are quite expensive and are usually bought by customers who live on the upper end of the income bracket. In contrast, the Android mobile platform is compatible with a large number of devices which cut across different price ranges. The customer base for Android enabled devices is varied; everyone from students to working professionals can afford an Android device.
Many businesses purchase Android devices in bulk to give their employees. This not only acts as an incentive for them to improve their performance, but also helps employees with their work. For example, giving Android enabled smart phones to employees will help them in recording and verification of data, managing their location and finding out the shortest routes to destinations. This will save both time and money.
If you have an iOS app which is catered to help such offices improve their productivity, you are missing out on a great business opportunity. An iOS enabled device will mostly be purchased by end users for their personal utility; businesses will focus on cheaper Android devices. Bring iOS app to Android and watch your profits soar!
