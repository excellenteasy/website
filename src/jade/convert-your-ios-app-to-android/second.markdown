### 2. Android devices are cheap

iOS is compatible with devices manufactured by Apple alone, namely the **iPhone and the iPad series**. These devices are **quite expensive** and are usually bought by retail customers. In contrast, the **Android platform is compatible with a large number of devices** which cut across different price ranges.

Not only is there a diverse customer base for Android devices, because everyone from student to professional can afford them, but you can **easily purchase Android devices in bulk for very specialized use-cases**. Just think of a field work staff, in-house applications or fields like outdoor use where you have to expect stolen or destroyed devices.
