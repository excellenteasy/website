# 3. Google Play is publisher friendly
App development is a lucrative business opportunity, but it requires an immense investment of effort, time and money. Once your app is developed, you would want it out on the market as soon as possible. However, if you have developed an app compatible with iOS alone, this might take a while. The worst case scenario is that your app may never see the light of day.
To get a listing on the iOS App Store, you have to send them the app, along with a list of words describing the app, three icons, a launch screen, screen shots and your contact information. Your app then goes through an extensive screening process which might take a week or longer. If you are lucky enough to survive this, you still have to wait for an official App Review before your app comes out on the App Store.
On Android's Google Play, all that you need to launch an app is a developer account and an account with Google Wallet. Once you register and pay the registration fees, you can upload your app in the APK (Android Application Package) format and either save it as draft or publish it when you are ready. Your app gets a listing on the Google Play store and you have a shot at recovering your costs. It is always prudent to move iOS app to Android; even if one market fails, you have a sure chance at the other.
