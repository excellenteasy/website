iOS App development is a lucrative business opportunity, but it requires an immense upfront investment. Once your app is developed, you would want it out on the market as soon as possible. However, if you have developed an app compatible for iOS alone, this might take a while. The worst case scenario is that **your app might even get rejected by Apple**.

**On Android's app store – Google Play – all you need to launch an app is a developer account**. Your app gets a listing without being reviewed, so you have a better shot at recovering your costs and taking higher risks for new and innovative approaches. It is always prudent to move iOS apps to Android so you can rapidly test new ideas and verify your business ideas.
