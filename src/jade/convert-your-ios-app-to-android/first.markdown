# 1. Android has the biggest market share
When it comes to mobile platforms, Google's Android and Apple's iOS are two of the largest players in the market. In a race of technology, where the prize is a large market share, Android and iOS have been running almost neck and neck. Recent statistics have shown that Android has taken the lead with over 900 million activations, while iOS came a distant second with 410 million activations. In the language of percentages, the Android mobile platform enjoys a staggering 70% of the global market, whereas, iOS has a 21% market share.
If you have a web based business, your success largely depends on the amount of interest which you can generate for your website or application. Greater number of people logging to your website or downloading your app translates into greater revenue for your product. It is important that you take all necessary steps to ensure that your app reaches the widest possible market.
If your app is compatible with iOS alone, you are excluding the large 900 million plus market which Android enjoys. It is a good business move on your part to convert iOS app into Android as it gives you access to a bigger customer base and increases long term profits.
