### 4. Make yourself independent

Most developers, both independent and corporate, do not focus on a single mobile platform. Almost all **major apps in the market today have versions compatible with both iOS and Android**. By doing so, developers are confident of having the largest share of the market at their disposal.

Market share is not the only reason though. It is necessary to **split your income into several streams** so you can't be out of business overnight. While Apple might deprecate an iOS feature, or remove your app from the store you could still be available on Android, or vice-versa. Remove such uninfluenceable factors from your business to ensure healthy and steady growth.
