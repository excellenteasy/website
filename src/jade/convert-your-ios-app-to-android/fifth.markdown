# 5. Google Play increases discoverability of your app
Once you have uploaded your app to Google Play or to the App Store, it is your job to ensure that your app comes up regularly on search engine results. You can do this by finding relevant keywords and using them in the title and in the description, as well as, by uploading screenshots and videos for your app. However, this is a dynamic process; you need to observe your market carefully and then make the significant changes.
Once your app has a listing on the iOS App Store, making amends in the title or description is quite a hassle. Such changes take time to appear, often as long as two or three weeks. In contrast, changing the app title or description is a breeze if your app is listed with the Google Play Store on the Android mobile platform. You can edit your app, update the title or make any necessary changes and instantly publish it again. Also, the App Store does not recognize use of keywords in the app description, but the Play Store does. This gives your app a bigger chance to pop up on search engines. Move iOS app to Android not just to take advantage of a lucrative business opportunity but also to reduce stress and hassle involved in successful marketing of the app.
