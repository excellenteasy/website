Imagine you go to a party and you look around to find that there is only one dish being served to everyone. You will face no problems if you like that dish but think about those people who either don't like that dish or are allergic to it. So, there is no unity amongst people in regard to liking a same dish. Similar thing is happening to the *Android* market these days. They have to serve the same *Android* app to different phones which are using *Android*.

How does one expect a single *Android* application to run on 4000 different phones and have no glitches or faults? It is a tremendous task for these application developers as they have to cook a dish that works for everyone. This is known as hardware fragmentation when a software and hardware seem to be incompatible.

## What problems do app developers face while developing an app for *Android*?

*Android* hardware fragmentation -The application developers are foremost posed with a really big challenge and that is to not do any fragmentation while developing an application. They have to cater to different hardware and technologies across more than 4000 phone companies that are on *Android* platform. Let us take an example of Samsung and Sony that are two different phone companies which use common platform that is *Android*. Now *Android* has to make sure that the application it develops should work in Samsung and Sony. The application developer will first have to examine both the phones according to the hardware and technology used and then he will have to create the functions of the application in such a way that it caters to the hardware of both the phones without having any glitches. Now imagine the same task being done for 4000 different phones and their models. I - Phone does not face this problem because it produces both hardware and software. This way it can ensure that its hard ware's are in sync with its software. It will also ensure that *iOS* and its versions support the software and the hardware. It is easy to create applications for *iOS* because they have limited number of hardware that needs to be in sync with the developing application. This is why one can find many creative applications in *iOS* than *Android*.

Different hardware of one company - One must understand that a single mobile company can sometimes create different hardware in order to upgrade their phones. This causes a lot of problem to the application developers. Not only do they have to make an application that is suitable to the rest 4000 mobile phones available in the market but they must now also test their application on different hardware versions of a single phone company. This not only hinders a good application to come in the market but also increases the amount of time required to develop a good application for the users. Doing this is extremely complicated and requires a lot of hard work and brain. This means that now the chef will not only have to cater 4000 people with one dish but will also have to cater according to their moods. This seems like an impossible task but imagine that application developers make impossible to possible everyday which is truly amazing.

Version and software incompatibility - Till now *Android* has come up with many versions of itself. The latest being the jelly being version. It will not be correct to say that all *Android* phones are using this version. This is because the mobile companies do not permit the users to install a higher version of *Android*. This further creates more fragmentation. The *Android* application developers also have to keep in mind that there application works on all versions of *Android* that is from gingerbread to jelly bean. This poses a great challenge for application developers as to how they can make an application, which works by detection of movement of eye, work across all versions without any faults. So this ends up fragmenting *Android* as all application can never work similarly on all the versions.

## Why you should be grateful to the *Android* app developers?

They create applications that are responsive apps and that are suited across different phones, models and versions.
Even if they copy an application from *iOS* market they are not merely copy and pasting anything. They have to make sure that the *iOS* application works across different phones, models and version in *Android*.
They give you interesting and useful applications despite the challenges that they face.
Most of the applications that are developed by *Android* application developers are functional across different phone companies and versions.

So not as easy you thought it was right? These impossible looking tasks are made possible by these application developers and they definitely deserve a lot of appreciation for their effort and hard work.
