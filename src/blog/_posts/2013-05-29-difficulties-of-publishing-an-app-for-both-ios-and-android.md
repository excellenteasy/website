title: The difficulties of publishing an app for both iOS and Android
---
{% include JB/setup %}

There's a thicker rather than a mere fine line which perceptibly creates the distinctions of *iOS* and *Android*, **the world's two largest mobile operating systems** [empowering over 90% of smartphones and tablets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Mobile_devices).

More than that, we should also accept the fact that most of us are having a hard time when it comes to leaping from one platform to another. For instance, when you ask a loyal *iOS* user to switch to an *Android*-powered device, you are more likely to come across a face filled with bafflement and disorientation than one that is painted with affirmation.

Nevertheless, the reaction is not surprising. However, this does not mean that we are trapped on a dead end. Simply understanding the differences of *iOS* and *Android* would certainly allow us to marvel – and soon – conquer them. <!-- more --><span id="more"></span>

## The Skin-Deep Divide

First things first – the said gigantic operating systems are birthed by equally distinct giants when it comes to the digital and mobile technology industry. [*Android* is a product of Google](http://www.android.com/) while [*iOS* is propped by Apple](http://www.apple.com/iphone/ios/).

As trivial as it may seem at a glance, the divergence when it comes to the manufacturers of the operating systems creeps towards more than what you could see on the price tag.

The said difference calls for an inconsistency between the programming of the two. While Google's *Android* fires mobile devices with its Java programmed interface, apps for *iPhones* and iPads are powered with Objective-C.

To put it in simpler terms, this means that it may be beyond imagining to run programs or open files that are crafted for an *Android* powered device into an *iOS*-powered gadget and vice versa. For instance, it's immpossible to run apps with an *.apk* file extension on an *iPhone* or an *iPad* and an *.ipa* on an *Android* device.

The bounds between the aforementioned mobile operating systems get even thicker as you try to experience both of them.

Particularly, *Android*'s graphical user interface clearly diverges from *iOS*' UIKit touch interfaces.

The graphical user interface (GUI) that could be experienced using *Android* devices utilizes particular images as signals to perform certain commands. To illustrate it, you could just [picture yourself unlocking the screen of an *Android*](http://www.android.com/about/ice-cream-sandwich/#face-unlock). When asked to slide your fingers, the line that you create is the image that signals your device to unlock its screen – allowing you then to perform other graphical or image-based functions.

Meanwhile, the gesture that is used by *iOS* uses commands that are pretty different from the GUI of the *Android* OS. While it also employs a gesture recognition system, it is essentially different. For instance, instead of creating an image of a vertical line, you may rather be prompted to create a horizontal line to unlock an *iPhone*, that's what we know as "slide to unlock".

The characteristics get even more complicated with the distinct app publishing opportunities offered. Apple sells only reviewed apps and exclusivly through their *App Store*, Google freely distributes theirs through *Google Play* and allows to install them from any source you like. Generally speaking this means you can install quality apps on *iOS*, but they are limited in their use cases. On *Android* you might encounter low quality software, but there are no limits of what they could do for you.

Most importantly, the choices get even more confined as both companies limit their products to certain devices. *iOS* is very limited to Apple platforms such as the *iPhone*, *iPod* touch & *iPad*. Meanwhile, *Android* explores larger markets as it shouts for compatibility to smartphones that are brought out by several leading manufacturers such as Samsung, HTC, Acer, Lenovo, LG, and such. While you can reach much more devices, and therefor people, with Android it's proportionally more effort to support all the different screen sizes and computing powers.

## Breaking the boundaries between Android and iOS

As previously mentioned, despite the obvious differences of *iOS* and *Android*, we are not trapped on a dead end. There is a way to erase the line that separates *Android* from *iOS* for app publishers.

Most of the cross-platform solutions offered won't take into account all of the fine differences we just had a look at. They simply ship the same looking App to both platforms. Results are just the lowest common denominator that fits both worlds, but certainly leaves disappointed user with an inappropriate user experience.

We at *excellenteasy* have specialized in converting existing iOS applications to Android. This means you can develop a native iOS application with an outstanding experience and we'll translate all the fine details to a carefully crafted Android app afterwards.
